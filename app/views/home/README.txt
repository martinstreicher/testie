Informz Ruby on Rails Coding Test This is the Ruby on Rails coding test for Informz. In a nutshell, you are being asked to create a Rails version of the "Fizz Buzz Test". The details of this are as follows: Create a new Rails application Fork this repository from Github The application will be a split between client side and server side work. The client side should print out the numbers from 1 to 100, inclusive.

For each number, it (the client) should make a remote call to determine whether the value is considered "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz". For multiples of three, the call should return "Fizz". For multiples of five, it should return "Buzz". For multiples of both three and five it should return "FizzBuzz". If none of these, return an empty string. The controller responsible for determining FizzBuzz-ness should have tests for it which pass when run While the client will only be responsible for printing out the numbers 1-100, the controller should be able to handle any (reasonable) positive or negative integer Invalid (i.e. non-integer) values should return a 404 Commit and push your changes to your fork
